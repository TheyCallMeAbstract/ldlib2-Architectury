/**
 * Which interactable a click in the scene belongs to.
 *
 * <p>{@link ISceneInteractable#onMouseClick} has always documented what it returns —
 * <i>"true to consume the event, false to pass it to the next interactable"</i> — and the dispatch
 * did not implement it: it visited every object in map order and OR-ed the answers together, so
 * nothing was ever passed to a <i>next</i> one and nothing could consume anything. With one
 * interactable that is invisible. With two overlapping ones, every one of them is told it was
 * clicked, and which of them "wins" is whichever happens to act last.
 *
 * <p>This is that contract: <b>nearest first, stop at the first that consumes</b>.
 *
 * <h2>⚠️ Objects with no shape are still offered the click</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link ISceneInteractable#getCollisionShape} is empty by default, so an interactable can exist
 * to receive clicks without describing a volume — and dropping those would be a silent behaviour
 * change for anything relying on the old broadcast. They go last, after everything the ray actually
 * hit, in the order they were visited.
