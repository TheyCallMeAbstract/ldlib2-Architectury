/**
 * Remembers where drawing was going, so a render pass can put it back.
 *
 * <p>The rule this exists to enforce: a pass that redirects rendering into its own textures must
 * restore <em>whatever was there before</em>, never {@code Minecraft.getMainRenderTarget()}. Those
 * two are the same thing only while the game window is the only place a frame can land, and that
 * assumption is wrong in two situations that both already exist:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>a UI drawn into an off-screen target — an element with a mask or an opacity below one renders
 *       through the visual-layer picture-in-picture pass, and a scene drawn inside it would escape
 *       into the game's frame;</li>
 *   <li>a UI hosted in its own operating-system window, where the main target is a different window
 *       entirely and anything restored to it is simply drawn somewhere the user is not looking.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>In 26.1 "where drawing goes" is not a bound framebuffer object but the pair of output texture
 * overrides on {@link RenderSystem}, which the command encoder resolves when it opens a render pass.
 * Capturing is therefore two field reads.
 *
 * <p>Usage is a try-with-resources around the pass:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * try (var ignored = RenderTargetScope.redirect(colorView, depthView)) {
 *     ...
 * } // previous overrides and viewport are back
 * }</pre>
